## Abstract
Sports video analysis is a key domain in computer vision,
enabling detailed spatial understanding through multi-view
correspondences. In this work, we introduce SoccerNetv3D
and ISSIA-3D, two enhanced and scalable datasets
designed for 3D scene understanding in soccer broadcast
analysis. These datasets extend SoccerNet-v3 and ISSIA
by incorporating field-line-based camera calibration and
multi-view synchronization, enabling 3D object localization
through triangulation. We propose a monocular 3D ball localization
task built upon the triangulation of ground-truth
2D ball annotations, along with several calibration and reprojection
metrics to assess annotation quality on demand.
Additionally, we present a single-image 3D ball localization
method as a baseline, leveraging camera calibration and
ball size priors to estimate the ballâ€™s position from a monocular
viewpoint. To further refine 2D annotations, we introduce
a bounding box optimization technique that ensures
alignment with the 3D scene representation. Our proposed
datasets establish new benchmarks for 3D soccer scene understanding,
enhancing both spatial and temporal analysis
in sports analytics.
